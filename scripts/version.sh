# version.sh prints the build's version, <X.Y.Z>-r<N>: the latest vX.Y.Z tag and
# how many commits stand on it. Every commit builds its own version, in order —
# the tagged commit is 0.2.0-r0, the third after it 0.2.0-r3 — so apk sees each
# one as an upgrade, and a new version is a new tag. A tree with no release tag
# builds 0.0.0-r0.
